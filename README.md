# flask_dbVisuals_shell

Hi Chaps, thought this might make your lives a bit easier.

This is a basic project shell that represents a 'bare bones example' of communication between a database, flask server and javascript fontend.
The project is intended for learning purposes and uses remnants of plotly.js and sqlite3

To run the project, first install all required dependencies into your environment and run the following command from a terminal within the uppermost project directory:

python3 -m flask run -h localhost -p 5000

Then in a browser, navigate to 'localhost:5000'. Voila. 

To recreate the test datatable, just run create_db from a terminal with the required dependancies.

Let me know if you would like clarifications or expansion in accordance with other projects we are working on

For any implementation queries, questions  or ideas on architectures, feel free to contact me.
