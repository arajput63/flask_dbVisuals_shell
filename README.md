# flask_dbVisuals_shell

This is a basic project shell that represents a 'bare bones example' of communication between a database, flask server and javascript fontend.
The project is intended for learning purposes and uses plotly.js to render visualisations for mock data stored in anm SQLite3 database.

To run the project, first install all required dependencies into your environment and run the following command from a terminal within the uppermost project directory:

python3 -m flask run -h localhost -p 5000

Then in a browser, navigate to 'localhost:5000'

Voila. For any implementation queries, questions  or ideas on architectures, feel free to contact me at:
